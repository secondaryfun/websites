				<th align="	left">Buyer beware, when you rent your vehicle and plan on heading into the mountains of Colorado, the rental car companies love to advertise 2 wheel drive versions of their SUV's.  When you arrive at the counter to pick up your ride, they then inform you of the "<a href="	https://www.codot.gov/travel/winter-driving/tractionlaw">traction law</a>" in Colorado.  For the low price of double your rental, they will kindly provide a 4WD version...  fuckers.</th>

				<th><p>After 3 hours on the mountain, and burning legs, we headed for Frisco, CO to find our airbnb. The view from the second floor condo showed the winter wonderland we would be enjoying for the next week.</p>
				<p>A quick trip to the grocery store and we loaded up on food for the week. The plan was to cook breakfasts and most dinners at the condo, and pack lunches for the slopes. The only exception being the mantadory pizza and beers at least once after skiing.</p>
